Docker, Docker volume, Docker Compose, Docker Engine, Networking, and Orchestration – A Comprehensive Guide

What is docker ?

Docker is a tool that allows you to build and run application in lightweight, portable containers.Those application will run on any system. These containers include everything needed to run application.Such as code,liberaries and dependencies.but they share the host system’s operating systems kernel.

What is container?

Container is an isolated environment which directly talk to kernel and create separate environment with Dockerfile. When you share it with your client it will create separate environment. Container are very lightweight and it can be share easily.

Some important keys -

Lightweight - docker containers are lightweight

Fast startup - they run fast your application

Portable - containers allows to run application in all environments.

Scalable - it can increase scalability of application according to the requirement.What is docker ?

Docker commands -

Docker commands are instructions that you run in the terminal to interact with docker, a tool used for creating , managing, and running containers. These commands help in building images, running containers, managing network, and much more.


Docker command are used to:

Create and manage containers - Run application in isolated environments.

Build and manage images - Package applications with dependencies.

Monitor and debug containers - Check logs, inspect containers, and troubleshoot.

Automate deployments - Use Dockerfile for CI/CD pipeline for software delivery.


Important commands -

docker —version = Shows the installed Docker version.

`docker pull <image name>` = download the image from dockerhub.

docker images = list images.

docker run -d -p 8080:80 <image name> = run the application.

-d = runs container in the background.

-p 8080:80 = map port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the host port.

docker ps = list all running containers.

docker ps -a = list all containers including stopped ones.

docker stop <container ID> = stop a running container.

docker start <container ID> = start a stopped container.

docker rm <container ID> = remove container.

docker rmi <image name> = remove an image.

docker restart <container id or name> = restart a cotainer.

docker logs <container id or name> = view logs of a container.

docker exec -it <container id or name> = execute a cammand inside a running container.

docker stop $(docker ps -aq) && docker rm $(docker ps -aq)= stop and remove all containers (cleanup).

docker rmi $(docker images -aq) = remove all images.

docker run <timer> = to run container with a time.

Dockerfile:

A Dockerfile is a script that contains a set of instructions to build a docker image. It automates the process of creating a containerized application by defining everything needed to run the application, such as :

The base image (e.g., ubuntu, alpine, node.js )

Dependencies and libraries

Install packages

Environment veriables

Command to execute when container runs

why do we use dockerfile:

Automation - helps in automating the image creation process.

Consistency - ensure that the application run the same way in all environment.

Portability - make it easy to share and deploy applications across different system.

Version control - allows tracking changes to the container setup using git.

Scalability - usefull for CI/CD pipeline and cloud deployment.

How to use a Dockerfile:

Create a dockerfile

Save the above content in the Dockerfile.

Build an image

Docker build -t <image name> .

Run a container

Docker run -d -p <host port:container port>

This way Dockerfile helps in efficiently building and running containerised application.

docker run -

docker images -

Docker volume:

Docker volume is a storage mechanism used to persist data generated by the containers, even after they are stopped or deleted.V olumes are managed by docker and are stored data in a specific directory /var/lib/docker on the host machine.

Why we use docker volumes:

Data persistence - Prevents data loss when containers stop or restart.

Isolation - keeps data separate from container file.

Easier backup & sharing - Volumes can be shared across multiple containers.

Performance - Better then bind mount for container management.

Security - Stored in docker’s managed directories rather then exposing host system files.

How to use docker volumes:

Create a docker volume

Docker volume create <volume name>

List all volume

Docker volume ls

Use a volume in a container

Docker run -d -v <volume name:/app/data> —name <container name> < image name>

( any data written to /app/data inside the container will be stored persistently in volume name.)

Inspect a volume

Docker volume inspect <volume name>

Remove a volume

Docker volume rm <volume name>

Remove all unused volume

Docker volume prune

Docker compose -

Docker Compose is a tool that helps manage multi-container docker application. It allows users to define and run your entire application , including services,network,and volumes,in a single docker-compose.yml file, making it easy to deploy and scale applications.

Key Benefits of Docker Compose:

Multi-Container Management – Allows easy handling of applications consisting of multiple services.

Portability – Ensures applications run consistently across different environments (local, staging, production).

Lifecycle Management – Provides commands to start, stop, and rebuild services efficiently.

Service Control – Enables services to be turned on/off dynamically on a server.

Core Functionalities:

Works across different environments without modification.

Allows monitoring of running containers.

Simplifies configuration and deployment using a declarative YAML file.


How to use docker compose

Step 1: Install Docker Compose

Step 2: Create a docker-compose.yml File

Step 3: Start the application

docker-compose up -d

Step 4: Checking running containers

docker-compose ps

Step 5: Stop the application

docker-compose down

Step 6: Restart or update the application

docker-compose up -d —build


Docker Engine -

Docker Engine is the core component of Docker that allows you to build, run and manage containers. It is lightweight runtime and containerization platform that enable application to run in isolated environments.

Components of Docker Engine:

Docker Daemon – Runs in the background and manages containers, images, network, and volumes.

API Server – Allows developers and other tools to communicate with Docker Deamon programmatically.

Docker CLI (docker commands) - A command-line tool to interact with Docker Daemon.

Types of Docker Engine

Docker Engine - Community (CE): Free and open-source version for developers.

Docker Engine - Enterprise (EE): Paid version with additional security and support for entrprises.

Key Functionalities:

Build and package applications into lightweight containers.

Deploy applications seamlessly across different infrastructures.

Efficiently manage multiple containers at scale

Docker network -

Networking is crucial for communication between different containers and services in a containerized environment. Docker provides several networking options to ensure seamless communication. ex- our one container is running in isolation, one more container is also running in isolation environment, so we create a network bridge, to bring both containers into one network( call bridge network).

Fundamentally there are 4 types of networks but overall 7 types of networks over here.

Types of Docker Networks:

Host Network

Uses the host machine’s network stack directly.

Eliminates the need for port mapping.

Limitation: Containers cannot have isolated network configurations.

Bridge Network (default networking mode)

Creates an isolated network for inter-container communication.

Requires explicit port mapping for external access.

None Network

Disables networking completely.

The container cannot communicate with other containers or the host machine.

Bridge network ( user defined network )

That network is defined by the users.

Container orchestration:

When applications grow, managing multiple containers manually becomes challenging. Orchestration automates container management, ensuring reliability and efficiency in production environments.

Key Features of Docker Orchestration:

Automated Deployment – Start and stop containers dynamically based on demand.

Scaling – Adjust resources up or down as per workload requirements.

Failure Management – Automatically restarts or replaces unhealthy containers.

Networking – Ensures seamless communication between distributed services.

Popular Container Orchestration Tools:

Kubernetes – Industry-standard orchestration platform, offering advanced features for large-scale deployments.

Docker Swarm – Docker’s native orchestration tool, designed for simplicity and ease of use.

Amazon ECS – AWS’s fully managed container orchestration service.Container orchestration:
